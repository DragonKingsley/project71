We have implemented our “Real Food for Kids” Salad Bar. All students are able to select their fruits and vegetables for lunch from the salad bar, and then they may complete their lunch by choosing either the salad bar protein and grains or the hot entrée listed on the menu for that day. Students “practice” salad bar etiquette and new procedures for the lunch line before the salad bar opens. We are excited that our students have so many fresh fruits and vegetables to choose from each day and are proud to have joined the many other FCPS schools that have had the opportunity to implement the salad bar successfully!

                        1. Lazy mistakes are highly avoidable and require low effort to fix. Often these mistakes can be corrected through mindfulness and attention to detail.
                        <br>
                        2. Ignorant Mistakes
                        Sometimes mistakes can occur simply because you don't know they exist. Ever put metal in a microwave as a kid? Or for my fellow marketers how about targeting grandparents on instagram? These are some standard examples of ignorant mistakes.
                        Ignorant mistakes are difficult to avoid, but require less effort to remedy. While typically unpleasant, these blunders can provide a valuable learning experience. The key to correcting these mistakes is to commit them to memory and minimize repetition 
                        But remember: you can only make ignorant mistakes once. Afterwards, they simply become lazy ones.

                        3. Beginner Mistakes
                        Unlike the previous two entries, beginner mistakes are wholly intentional. These are the types of errors that come from trying to learn something new. My favorite example is learning a new instrument. No matter how many YouTube videos you watch, you’re not going to be able to play the Free Bird solo on your first try. (Link for the uninitiated 
                        Beginner mistakes are difficult to avoid and require higher effort to resolve. Luckily, these are the types of mistakes that are often encouraged by society. When you hear startup gurus tell you to “fail fast” and “leave your comfort zone”, they are usually referencing beginner mistakes.</p>
